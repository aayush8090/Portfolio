          As a Computer Science and Engineering student from Lovely Professional University, I am highly driven to achieve results and passionate about developing strategies that are based on data-driven decisions.
           I possess excellent skills in communication and collaboration, and I am adept at technical documentation with different stakeholders. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with web development using ReactJS and other software applications, including CRM software. 
           This practical experience has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of the intricacies of these tools and how they can be leveraged to achieve desired outcomes.
